<p>Over on Alex Munroe's blog there's a great example of why PHP is so evil:<a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"> it's a fractal of bad design</a>. I'm half placing this here for other people, half for me to send to people when they ask me what's wrong with PHP. Of course, you could just hate dollar signs in front of variables, Anthony.</p>
